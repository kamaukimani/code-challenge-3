# Simple Blog/Post Manager

## Description
The project is a simple blog/post manager web app that allows users to view a list of blog posts, see details of a selected post, and add new posts locally through a form. It demonstrates fetching and displaying posts from a backend API, dynamically updating the UI, and managing user interactions like selecting posts and submitting new content.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content rendering and event handling.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JSON Server**: Used as a mock backend API to serve and fetch blog posts.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.

## Features
- Fetches and displays a list of blog posts from a backend.
- Allows users to click on a post to view detailed content.
- Provides a form to add new posts locally (no backend persistence yet).
- Automatically selects and displays the first post when the page loads.
- Handles user interactions with dynamic DOM updates.

## Challenges
One challenge faced was managing asynchronous data fetching and ensuring the UI updates correctly once data arrives. Handling event listeners for dynamically created elements also required careful structuring. Additionally, validating form inputs before adding new posts helped maintain data integrity.
